# Geoscience and coordinates
Help with some routine problem

P.S. I have some friends who work like this, and It really made their job easier

Tis is a repository for those who work with geology, mining and also for those who work with coordinates and creating tables based on them.

1. [Make empty table](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Make%20empty%20table) - Program that creates a table for coordinates with your number of rows.
2. [Area calculate](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Area%20calculate) - Program calculate area with Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula) use Global Mapper export file or your own file.
3. [Txt to xlsx](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Txt%20to%20Xlsx) - Program that helps to transfer data from Global Mapper export file or your own file to a xlsx table using the right number of decimal.
