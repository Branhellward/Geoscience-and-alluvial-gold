# Geoscience and coordinates
Help with some routine problem

P.S. I have some friends who work like this, and It really made their job easier 

------

Tis is a repository for those who work with geology, mining and also for those who work with coordinates and creating tables based on them.

1. [Make empty table](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Make%20empty%20table) - Program that creates a table for coordinates with your number of rows.
2. [Area calculate](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Area%20calculate) - Program calculate area with Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula) use Global Mapper export file or your own file.
3. [Txt to xlsx](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Txt%20to%20Xlsx) - Program that helps to transfer data from Global Mapper export file or your own file to a xlsx table using the right number of decimal.
4. [Txt to xlsx XY](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Txt%20to%20Xlsx%20XY) - Program that helps to transfer data from Global Mapper export file or your own file to a xlsx table use Gauss Krueger XY coordinates.
5. [Reverse export](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Reverse%20export) - Program that helps to convert data from xlsx table to Global Mapper and import coordinates.
6. [Reverse export XY](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/Reverse%20export%20XY) - Program that helps to convert data from xlsx table to Global Mapper and import coordinates use Gauss Krueger XY coordinates.
7. [GeoCalc extension](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/GeoCalc%20extension) - Program that helps to convert our .xlsx table to .txt file and back again then use it with Phgeocalc.
0. [All in one](https://github.com/Branhellward/Geoscience-and-coordinates/tree/main/All%20in%20one) - Program that contain all previous program in one.
------

I hope it can help you to save some time in future
